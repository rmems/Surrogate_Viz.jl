# Telemetry provenance — is this run's data measured, or fabricated?
#
# `run_status` (derived from validation_status) says whether a run COMPLETED.
# `telemetry_provenance` (derived from telemetry_source) says whether its
# numbers were MEASURED. These are independent, and conflating them is how a
# synthesised run ends up presented as a measurement: a run can be
# `completed` — so run_status == real, badged green — while corinth-canal
# actually fell back to synthesising its telemetry.
