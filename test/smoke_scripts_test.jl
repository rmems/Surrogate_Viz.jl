# Smoke tests for the root-level entry-point scripts.
#
# These scripts are not part of the package and were, until recently, executed
# by nothing at all — no test and no CI job loaded them. That gap let a script
# ship with a load-time error that made it impossible to run (a TOML stdlib
# resolved by a UUID registered to no package, fixed in #51). The point of
# these tests is narrow but specific: prove each script still *loads*, and that
# loading it does not run its `main()`.
#
# Each script is included into a throwaway module so its constants and
# functions do not leak into the test session, and the active project is
# restored afterwards in case a script activates one at load time.

Load `relpath` (relative to the repo root) into a fresh anonymous module.

Returns the sandbox module, the active project before the include, and the
active project observed *immediately after* it. The caller compares those two
to detect a load-time `Pkg.activate`; the `finally` block below repairs the
damage, so checking after cleanup would always pass and prove nothing.
